# Code Buster Rules

## Setup

- There are 8 available colours: `red`, `green`, `blue`, `yellow`, `purple`, `cyan`, `white`, and `pink`.
- The game starts with a random code of 4 colours. The code is hidden from the player.
- The player has 10 attempts to guess the code.
- Each guess must consist of 4 colours.
- After each guess, the player receives feedback:
  - A black peg indicates a correct colour in the correct position.
  - A white peg indicates a correct colour in the wrong position.
  - No peg means no correct colours.
- The player can use the feedback to adjust their next guess.
- The game ends when the player guesses the code correctly or runs out of attempts.
